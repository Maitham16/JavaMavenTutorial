Maven Profiles: Profiles in Maven provide a set of configuration values that can be used to 
                set or override default values. Using profiles, you can customize builds for 
                different environments such as Production or Development environments.

Profiles can be explicitly defined in the POM, inherited from a parent POM, or specified via 
the command line. Profiles specified on the command line should use the property 
maven.profile (e.g. -P maven.profile).

You can use these profiles to adjust the build process based on the current environment. 
For example, you may want to skip running tests when building for development but want to 
make sure tests are run when building for production.
